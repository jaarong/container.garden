After some health issues, I started reading and learning more about nutrition.  Trying to get my diet in check, and stop eating junk. My blood pressure and cholesterol was simply too high. I started tracking what I ate and my sodium was through the roof. Some of what I was eating had trans fat, and most of it was processed.    

I looked to the internet, books, and friends.  The answer was one I didn’t want to hear.  You need real food.  The kind near the front of the store.  The kind without labels. The kind you have to pay extra for and put in work to prepare. 

What was offered at the grocery store didn’t look that appealing to me.  It looked sad.  Picked days or weeks ago, packed in a bag, and shipped hundreds of miles.  These vegetables were a shell of their former selves.  

I had lived in a rural area for my entire childhood, so gardening seemed like the perfect answer.  Well, not perfect, I had no idea what I was doing.  After four books, several tools, and some back breaking work, I was the proud owner of a small square garden.

Frustration was high, production was low, but pride was through the roof.  I was growing my own food.  Even if it was just two or three salads some months and some bagged beans for the freezer. Some of frustrations with an in-ground garden led me to container gardening which I loved and really helped me solve some of the issues I had with growing certain vegetables in my area. I decided to explore it more.   

That will be the mission of this blog.  Taking others on this journey with me into the world of container gardening.  To tell others that are in search of real food about my experience growing it.
