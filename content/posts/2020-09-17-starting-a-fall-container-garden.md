I've begun to start some seeds for my fall container garden hoping the heat is curtailed by some cold fronts by the end of September. Most of my choices can take a little heat and a little cold, which was a major factor in choosing them.

In this photo, I've got "Ruby Red" Swiss Chard, "Esmee" Arugula, Mizuna, "Bush Champion" Zucchini, and Lemon Squash. I've had some pretty bad luck with winter squash in my garden with squash bugs killing the plant before I harvest anything, but I finally tried them in containers in the spring and had a big harvest. So, I'm going to try for a rerun of that in the fall. Swiss chard has just been a workhorse for me for a long time and seems to be able to take spring/fall heat and winter cold. The mizuna and arugula are kind of new choices to try to add some flavor to my salads.
